                <p> Sports is one of the most popular and generally understood <br>
                    areas of personal and emotional investment. Fans spend countless <br>
                    hours watching and evaluating their favorite athletes and teams, <br>
                    and going as far as to find mediums for financial and competitive <br>
                    gain as sports viewers via outlets including fantasy sports <br>
                    leagues, memorabilia collection, and the growing space of <br>

                    offerings that allow fans to preliminarily tie their financial <br>
                    gain to their preexisting sports fandom, they don’t give fans an <br>
                    inherent connection to said athletes that they idealize. <br>

                    their favorite sports personalities, providing the idyllic <br>
                    “team owner” feeling to the average fan, just as fantasy sports <br>
                    have empowered every fan to feel like a coach or manager?<br>
